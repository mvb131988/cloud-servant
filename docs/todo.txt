(1) Create separate thread for both local/global scan, run it periodically (once a week)
if no ip addresses found run it immediately after the previous run.
On get ip addresses(different thread) read already discovered/persisted addresses and try them 
to connect, use only PersistenceManager.  

Goal: autodiscovery is run is separate thread, all found addresses are persisted, based on
	  the result of previous autodiscovery scheduling decision is made.
	  
	  Get ip addresses tries addresses persisted by PersistenceManager. No need to use 
	  failure counter. If there are no ip addresses just keep reading PersistnceManager
	  until it gets something.
